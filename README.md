## Setting up your development environment

To develop and test your CLI toolset, you'll need to set up your development environment with the following tools:

- [Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install): Make sure that you have Go installed and configured on your system. You can check if Go is installed by running the command `go version` in your terminal.

- [Cobra CLI library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): Cobra is a popular CLI library for Go that provides a simple and easy-to-use API for building command-line interfaces. You can install Cobra using the command `go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra`.

Once you have installed Go and Cobra, you're ready to start building your CLI toolset.

## Getting started with your CLI toolset

To get started with your CLI toolset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repo-url>`.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.

3. Build and install your CLI toolset by running the command `go install`.

4. Test your CLI toolset by running one of the commands defined in your `main.go` file, such as `dataverse version` or `dataverse generate`.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to set up your development environment and start building your CLI toolset. If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to refer to the documentation or reach out to the community for help.
